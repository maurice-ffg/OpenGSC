// Period-style controls (the dashboard window, report days, decay buckets) used to be bare
// component state: a refresh reset them, no link could carry them, and every screen silently
// started from its own hardcoded default. This hook gives them two stores, read in one order:
//
//   URL param (when `urlParam` is passed)  — a link that says ?period=12m means it, so the
//                                            report a client opens is the report you saw;
//   localStorage (when `key` is passed)    — the last value this browser was set to, the same
//                                            role gsc_sort already plays for sort order;
//   fallback                               — the old hardcoded default, last resort.
//
// Writes go to both stores. The URL write uses history.replaceState rather than the router,
// so changing a period never pushes a history entry (back keeps meaning "previous page") and
// never triggers a Next navigation — the fetch effects keyed on the value do the refetching.
// Reading window.location directly (instead of useSearchParams) keeps pages that have no
// other use for search params out of the Suspense requirement.
